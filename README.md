## Summary of findings
The question "What factors affect appointment attendance?" guided the analysis on dataset where 4 variables were investigated; Gender, Existence of Disease, SMS received and Scholarship (sponsored healthcare). Below are the main findings from analysis:
1. The gender has no effect on the no_show appointment. Both Male and Female miss their appointment roughly 20% of time
2. For all disease group (i.e. Diabetes, Hypertension and Alcoholism) appointment attendance improved slighlty except for alcoholism which maintained a similar proportion (i.e. 20%) to that of the general No Show Appointment Trend. People with Hypertension tended to have the best appointment attendance
3. With multiple ailments, attendance also improved. The best appointment attendance came from people with a combination of hypertension and alcoholism which had very little no shows.
4. People without scholarship tended to attend their scheduled appointments compared with those who had their healthcare sponsored or had scholarship
